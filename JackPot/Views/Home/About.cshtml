        <br />
        <p>
            Founders started life in 2013. No crazy anecdotes, we started Founders because we strongly believed there was a better way to build investation companies.
            <br />
            <br />
            Today our family has grown to 100+ amazing people in Copenhagen and Berlin building products that radically improve how individuals and organisations work.
            <br />
            <br />
            Our vision then and now is to develop a model that enables us to co-found successive companies on a single platform that gets smarter with each success and failure, thereby increasing our chances of success.
            <br />
            <br />
            We believe in launching early and iterating fast, knowing that failing is just a way to find out what doesn't work.
